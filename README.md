# Supplier-Management-Project---Software-Requirements-and-Design-Specification
This repository contains the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) and Software Design Specification (SDS) documents for the Supplier Management Project. The Supplier Management Project is a GUI-based application developed in Java using Java Swing as part of the Software Design and Architecture (SDA) course.
The SRS document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements of the Supplier Management Project. It defines the scope of the project, identifies the target users, and provides a comprehensive analysis of the system's requirements. The document covers aspects such as user interfaces, system functionalities, data management, security, and performance. It serves as a reference for developers, designers, and project stakeholders, ensuring a clear understanding of the project goals and functionalities.

The SDS document, on the other hand, focuses on the software design aspects of the Supplier Management Project. It describes the overall system architecture, modules, and their interactions. The document presents detailed design specifications, including class diagrams, sequence diagrams, and UI wireframes. It provides insights into the project's structure, organization, and implementation approach, facilitating effective collaboration among team members and guiding the development process.

By documenting the software requirements and design specifications, this repository aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Supplier Management Project. It serves as a valuable resource for future enhancements, maintenance, and troubleshooting of the application. Developers, designers, and software architecture enthusiasts can benefit from the insights provided in these documents and use them as a reference for similar projects or as a learning resource for software design and architecture principles.
